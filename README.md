## Summary

Vehicle accidents are a stressful situation and you often lose sight of what to do. CrashNinja is an application for guiding the user through a step by step process on how to deal with the situation. CrashNinja saves all the information related to the accident and automatically sends it to your insurance company. CrashNinja is a web and mobile application built in Ionic/Cordova.
